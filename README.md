# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECTS

This repository contains implementations of several fundamental machine learning algorithms, including K-Means, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Regularization techniques. These algorithms are implemented from scratch and are designed to help understand their inner workings and applications in data science and machine learning.

This project provides a hands-on implementation of the most commonly used supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
